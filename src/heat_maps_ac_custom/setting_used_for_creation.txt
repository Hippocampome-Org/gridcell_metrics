Notes:

All cells had fields other than the central 7 edited out. NS found that for the largest field autocorr. plots (e.g., n10, n11) only 7 fields really appeared pretty well so for consistency using 7 fields for every plot could make sense.

n3 was edited to added 2 fields that were missing
n4 had fields cropped in it to fit with original plot
n6 had fields cropped in it to fit with original plot
n7 was skipped for analysis due to having a grid score below 0.19
n8 I thought perhaps the fields should be trimmed but left them the way they are to try to limit editing. I think the autocorr. maybe widened the fields to an extent.
n9 was skipped for analysis due to having a grid score below 0.19
n12 had 2 fields expanded to fit with original plot
n15 had 2 fields expanded to fit with original plot
n17 had a judgment call of cropping 2 fields at their edges to separate from other fields
n21 had 5 fields expanded to fit with original plot
n28 a judgment call was made to not edit this to minimize overall edits and
because it seem to fit the original plot well enough
n29 a judgment call was made to not edit this to minimize overall edits and
because it seem to fit the original plot well enough
