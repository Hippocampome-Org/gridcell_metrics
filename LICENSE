The file circ_dist2.m uses code from the CircStat for Matlab project by Philipp Berens. This code is available at https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab. An article on this code is: 

Berens, P. (2009). CircStat: a MATLAB toolbox for circular statistics. Journal of statistical software, 31, 1-21. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v031.i10
