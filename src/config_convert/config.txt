plot_filepath, "heat_maps_real/n20.mat"
use_binary_input, 1, select to use (1) or not (0) binary input files as opposed to plain text input files
heat_map_selection, 31
use_ac, 1, choose to use autocorrelogram (ac) (1) or standard rate map (0)
convert_to_ac, 1, automatically convert rate map input into an autocorrelogram
use_dist_thresh, 0, experimental feature that may not yet work correctly
dist_thresh, 500
use_fld_sz_thresh, 0, experimental feature that may not yet work correctly
fld_sz_thresh, 6
manual_field_exclud, 0, field indices to exclude from spacing statistics

only_center_seven, 1, filter out fields except for the seven closest to the center of the plot
inout_excl, 1, filter out fields detected beyond the center seven in in_out_fields_ratio. Note: this does not use advanced detection to detect the fields outside the central seven. This option can only be used if only_center_seven is enabled.
use_tophat_filter, 0, filter neural firing through a tophat filter. Note: this may not work correctly.
use_centsurr_filter, 0, filter neural firing through a center-surround filter. Note: this may not work correctly.

custom, 0, group of custom configuration settings
custom2, 0, group of custom configuration settings
custom3, 0, group of custom configuration settings
custom4, 0, group of custom configuration settings
sml_ang_cnt_fld, 361, smallest angle from the center field. default value for this is 361, which is beyond 360, and that is intended to be beyond the highest angle possible.

cov_between_fields_reporting, 1, report the mean of the coefficient of variation of the firing rate (or correlation values in the case of autocorrelograms) across fields.
report_gridscore, 0, report grid score metrics
report_orientation2, 1, report Opexebo methods based orientation measurement.
min_orientation2, 15, minimum angle used in orientation2 measurement
report_centroid_positions, 0, output centroid positions

outlier_removal, 1, enable automatic removal of outlier points in fields. This can only be used if advanced_detection is enabled.
outlier_allowance, 0.25, amount, as a percentage, of outlier distance from median field radius to field boundaries to allow. Value is relative to 1 being 100%, e.g., 0.25 is 25% and 2 is 200%.
