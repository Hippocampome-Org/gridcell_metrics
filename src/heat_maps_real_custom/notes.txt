All cells had custom heat maps edited. Specific edit details are not recorded to save time.
Any field touching a border was removed unless the border contact was very minimal.

Nonfld_filt_perc is the starting point for filtering non-field firing in the plots and is a parameter in the matlab software. Cells started with "nonfld_filt_perc=.26;" unless otherwise noted.
n1: 3 fields at bottom of plot were separated with manual editing. Center field was slightly enlarged.
n2 nonfld_filt_perc=.6;

n5 nonfld_filt_perc=.26;
n6 nonfld_filt_perc=?
n8 nonfld_filt_perc=?
n10 nonfld_filt_perc=.35; unclear that any fields were beyond borders enough but kept 2 fields included for now.
